					Everybody's Sad is VR game made as a final project for the CMPM 160 
					series. The game was made on <a href="https://unity.com/" target="_blank">Unity</a> using Unity's VR source code. The game 
					takes place in a room where there are certain objects in the area which 
					need help of some sorts. The player's objective is to satisfy these objects 
					eventually leave the room by progressing the story.

					My personal contribution to the project was general programming, 
					but more importantly I was in charge of doing the graphics programming. 
					My job was to create shaders for particular characters in the game and also 
					applying full screen effects on the camera. Some of the effects I created 
					include a cell shading I made to apply on important characters in the game, 
					and a fullscreen effect that adds a greyscale effect to the screen when the 
					player reaches a certain point in the game.
